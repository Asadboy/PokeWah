UI Designer Perspective
Overall Look & Feel:

Theme & Aesthetic:

Use a modern, minimalistic design that subtly nods to Pokémon with playful yet clean elements.

A color palette inspired by Pokémon card borders (e.g., vibrant accent colors balanced with neutral backgrounds) to make images and prices stand out.

Typography:

Bold, easy-to-read fonts for headings (e.g., “Most Expensive Hit of the Week”) and clean sans-serif fonts for body text.

Consistent sizing hierarchy to emphasize key information like card prices and names.

Layout & Components:

Carousel Component:

A central carousel that displays three Pokémon card “hits” at a time.

Smooth sliding animation that shifts one card every 5 seconds.

Each card will include a high-quality image, name, price overlay, and subtle drop-shadow or border for separation.

Include navigation dots or subtle arrows to indicate position and allow manual control if needed.

Highlights Section:

Separate panels on the homepage to show “Most Expensive Hit of the Week” and “Worst Hit of the Week.”

These panels can have a slightly different style (e.g., a highlighted border or distinct background) to draw attention.

Future Enhancements:

Reserve space for an interactive poll component.

Design a dynamic section to reflect real-time updates from a Discord bot trigger, possibly with a “Latest Hit” ticker.

Responsive & Interactive Design:

Responsiveness:

Use Tailwind CSS to build a mobile-friendly interface ensuring that the carousel and highlight sections adapt to various screen sizes.

Interactive Feedback:

Incorporate subtle hover effects and transitions to enhance user engagement.

Ensure accessibility with clear focus states, legible text contrasts, and keyboard navigability.

Lead Developer Perspective
Tech Stack & Architecture:

Frontend:

Use Next.js with React for server-side rendering and dynamic routing.

Leverage Tailwind CSS to rapidly style components and achieve a responsive design.

Backend & Data Management:

Use Supabase as the open-source backend/database store to persist card data and weekly hit statistics.

Store card data (e.g., card ID, name, image URL, price, hit categorization) in structured tables for fast retrieval.

Deployment & Version Control:

Host on Vercel for optimized Next.js deployments.

Maintain the codebase in a GitHub repository with CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates.

API Integrations & Data Flow:

Pokémon Card Data:

Integrate with a reliable Pokémon TCG API (for example, Pokémon TCG API) to fetch card details.

Maintain an array of Pokémon card objects in the frontend that gets updated either on page load or via scheduled API calls.

Pricing Data:

Look into integrating with the TCG Player API to retrieve up-to-date card pricing.

Cross-reference data between the Pokémon TCG API and TCG Player API to enrich the card objects with price information.

Dynamic Updates & Discord Bot Integration:

Create Next.js API routes that the Discord bot can hit (e.g., via a simple endpoint like /api/updateHit/[cardId]).

Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates on the PokeWah site when a new card “hit” is reported via Discord.

Carousel Implementation:

Develop a React component that accepts the sorted array of card objects.

Use state and the useEffect hook to handle automatic sliding every 5 seconds.

Ensure smooth animations and proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks.

Performance & Security Considerations:

Cache API responses where applicable to reduce load times.

Secure sensitive API keys using environment variables.

Optimize image loading with lazy loading techniques and use Next.js image optimization.

Additional Developer Considerations:

Error Handling & Logging:

Implement robust error handling on API routes and incorporate logging for debugging purposes.

Testing & CI/CD:

Write unit and integration tests for key components (carousel, API endpoints).

Utilize GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy automatically to Vercel.

Scalability:

Architect the backend (Supabase and API integrations) to handle potential spikes in traffic or rapid updates from the Discord bot.
